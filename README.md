# SmartSolutions

The task manager was made on Angular 14.  
This project contains:  
Sign up page  
Sign in page  
Home page  
    -Cards  
Profile page  
    For admins:  
    -List of all users  
    -Create a new user (admin or ordinary)  
    -Personal Info  
    For ordinary:  
    -Personal info  
On both sign in data is being saved in local storage to access the app with no re-login. However, if you will go to the sign in page, the local storage will be cleared and you will have to either sign in or sign up.  
Authorization was made from frontend.  
JWT authorization code commented, needs backend implementation.  
  
Admin user for test:  
username: admin  
password: admin123  
  
Ordinary user for test:  
username: notadmin  
password notadmin123  
  
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
